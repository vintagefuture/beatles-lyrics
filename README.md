** What are the most used words in the Beatles' catalog?*

I thought this would be fun. The Beatles is my favourite band _of all times_; but let's be honest, their lyrics are not always the most original. The other I wondered what could be the most used word in the entire catalog, excluding of course commons ones like articles, prepositions, pronouns, etc.
A theme emerges from listening to their songs: money. I think the Beatles were particularly obsessed by money. This little experiment confirms this, at least partially.

Here are the first 50 words:

good 124
need 125
ill 134
time 135
baby 139
like 141
if 149
one 149
can 153
youre 157
want 157
no 160
but 165
girl 168
with 168
when 172
see 173
her 173
come 184
oh 189
do 191
she 196
for 197
now 203
got 209
what 212
so 218
its 225
im 253
know 263
of 268
dont 268
your 272
is 275
that 304
on 312
yeah 314
be 318
it 328
my 348
in 377
all 402
love 444
and 650
a 654
to 730
me 804
the 966
i 1262
you 1559

Money doesn't make it in the top 50, I'm very happy that I was wrong. "Love" shines in 8th position!

These results are subject of course to a great margin of error - I can't vouch for the lyrics, which are from http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/The_Beatles - but it gives a general idea. 

Hope someone finds this interesting!
