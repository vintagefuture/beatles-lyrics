**What are the most used words in the Beatles' catalog?**

I thought this would be fun. The Beatles is my favourite band _of all times_. The other day I was wondering what could be the most used word in the entire catalog, excluding of course commons ones like articles, prepositions, pronouns, etc.
I think the Beatles were a bit obsessed with money, and I was wondering in particular how often it appears. 
This little experiment shows that money is not that used actually, which makes me very happy :-)

Here are the first 50 words I found wiht the Python script:
```
you 1559
i 1262
the 966
me 804
to 730
a 654
and 650
love 444
all 402
in 377
my 348
it 328
be 318
yeah 314
on 312
that 304
is 275
your 272
dont 268
of 268
know 263
im 253
its 225
so 218
what 212
got 209
now 203
for 197
she 196
do 191
oh 189
come 184
her 173
see 173
when 172
with 168
girl 168
but 165
no 160
want 157
youre 157
can 153
one 149
if 149
like 141
baby 139
time 135
ill 134
need 125
good 124
```

_Money_ doesn't make it in the top 50, but _love_ shines in *8th position*, more used than _in_!

These results are subject of course to a great margin of error - I can't vouch for the lyrics, which are from http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/The_Beatles - but I hope it gives a general idea. 

Hope someone finds this interesting!
