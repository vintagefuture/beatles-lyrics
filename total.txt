I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
Id love to turn you on

One

Woke up fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Huh huh huh huh

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
Id love to turn you on

Its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say
Youre gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan
Cause when I get you alone
You know Ill feel okay

When Im home
Everything seems to be right
When Im home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight yeah

Its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow

So why on earth should I moan
Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When Im home
Everything seems to be right
When Im home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight yeah

Ooh its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Doo doo ndoo
Doo doo ndoo

I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh I will return
Yes I will return
Ill come back
For the honey and you

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though were far apart

That taste of honey
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh I will return
Yes I will return
Ill come back Hell come back
For the honey For the honey
And you

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction

When your bird is broken 
Will it bring you down
You may be awoken 
Ill be round
Ill be round

You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
And your bird can swing 
But you cant hear me 
You cant hear me

To set you free girl

That I still love you so
But if he loves you more

Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I what am I supposed to do

You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
Ive been searching for a girl

Shes sweeter than all the girls and Ive met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so Im telling you this time youd better stop
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I dont wanna say that Ive been unhappy with you
But as from today well Ive seen somebody thats new
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I dont wanna say that Ive been unhappy with you
But as from today well Ive seen somebody thats new
I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

If I cry its not because Im sad

Many many many nights go by

What can I do when its true
Dont want nobody nobody

Baby Youre a Rich Man
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you travelled very far
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesnt show

Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that youve found another key
What are you going to play

Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man
Baby youre a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo

For the benefit of Mr Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques fair what a scene

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr Kite flies through the ring dont be late

Messrs K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr H will demonstrate
Ten somersets hell undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill

Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry baby cry

Picking flowers for a friend who came to play

With a message at the local bird and bee

So cry baby cry

At twelve oclock a meeting round the table
For a séance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

Cry cry cry baby

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there

All the lonely people

All the lonely people Ah look at all the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right where I belong
Im right where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door

Im painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go

And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right where I belong
Im right where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they dont get past my door

Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her
You need her
And yet you dont believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said will fill your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere
And if shes beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere
And if shes beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never die

When youre here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me
Its not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why
I dont mind
I could wait forever
Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind
And tell you
Maybe youd understand

If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh you know I will
I will

Mm
Dadadadadada da

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

If I needed someone to love 
Youre the one that Id be thinking of 
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone 
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this 
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall 
And maybe you will get a call from me 
If I needed someone 

Ah ah ah ah 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone 
Had you come some other day

Carve your number on my wall 
And maybe you will get a call from me 
If I needed someone

You know if you break my heart Ill go
But Ill be back again
Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
Im the one who wants you
Yes Im the one who wants you oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that Im
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that Im
Not trying to pretend

I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you oh

You if you break my heart Ill go
But Ill be back again

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
Id get myself locked up today
But I cant so Ill cry instead

Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet
I cant talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
Id try to make you sad somehow
But I cant so Ill cry instead

Dont want to cry when theres people there
I get shy when they start to stare
Im gonna hide myself away
But Ill come back again someday

And when I do youd better hide all the girls
Im gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes Im gonna break em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then Ill cry instead

Dont want to cry when theres people there
I get shy when they start to stare
Im gonna hide myself away
But Ill come back again someday

And when I do youd better hide all the girls
Cause Im gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes Im gonna break em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then Ill cry instead

One day youll look 
To see Ive gone
For tomorrow may rain so
Ill follow the sun

Some day youll know 
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain so
Ill follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know oh

One day youll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so
Ill follow the sun

Yeah tomorrow may rain so
Ill follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know oh

One day youll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so
Ill follow the sun

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

You dont look different 
But you have changed

You were above me 
But not today 
The only difference 
Is youre down there 
Im looking through you
And youre nowhere 

Why tell me why

Of disappearing overnight

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float upstream float upstream

Please dont wake me
No dont shake me
Leave me where I am
Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need theres no need

Please dont spoil my day
Im miles away
And after all
Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please dont spoil my day
Im miles away
And after all
Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float upstream float upstream

Please dont wake me
No dont shake me
Leave me where I am

Im so tired
I havent slept a wink
Im so tired
My mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no

Im so tired
I dont know what to do
Im so tired
My mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you
But I know what you would do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke
Its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep
I cant stop my brain
You know its three weeks
Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got for a little peace of mind

Im so tired
Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired
Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke
Its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep
I cant stop my brain
You know its three weeks
Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got for a little peace of mind
Id give you everything Ive got for a little peace of mind
Id give you everything Ive got for a little peace of mind

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is noone compares with you oohoohooh
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new oohoohooh
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me

Rita

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two

Oh lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Lovely Rita meter maid

Theyll never believe it

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And shes gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And youre gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with lookingglass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing fifty times I must not be so ohoh oh

He creeps up from behind 

Bang bang Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head dodo dodoodoo

Painting testimonial pictures oh ohoh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free Maxwell must go free
The judge does not agree and he tells them so ohoh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind 

Bang bang Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head dodo dodoodoo
Clang clang Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead 
Whoa whoa whoaoh

Mean Mr Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
Shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Sound of music as she flies

Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun

Yeah yeah yeah

This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasnt you but I saw you peep through
Your window

I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone they said you were not home
Thats a lie
Cause I know where youve been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand with another man
In my place

If I were you Id realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

Ive tried to telephone they said you were not home
Thats a lie
Cause I know where youve been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

No reply

I once had a girl or should I say
She once had me
She showed me her room isnt it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
Its time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire isnt it good
Norwegian wood

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now youve changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
Its through
Youre giving me the same old line
Im wondring why
You hurt me then
Youre back again
No no no
Not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now youve changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine

You hurt me then
Youre back again
No no no

Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade
Hed let us in knows where weve been
In his octopuss garden in the shade
Id ask my friends to come and see
An octopuss garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade

We would be warm
Below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the sea bed
In an octopuss garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
lies beneath the ocean waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
happy and theyre safe
We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden with you
In an octopuss garden with you
In an octopuss garden with you

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not
He just wrote it like that

When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a northern song

It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
WhenAs its only a northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct
Theres nobody there

And I told you theres noone there

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
Its a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Every one of them knew that as time went by
Theyd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but

Yellow underclothes
So any road we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasnt any good at all
So I said Id marry join the bloody Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair my wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for wearing

Um da
Aaah

How
The dogs were dogging the cats were catting
The birds were birding and the fish were fishing
The men were themming and the when were whimming

Only to find the nightwatchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9 number 9 number 9 
Number 9 number 9 number 9

Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rockroll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rockroll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

And she declaim a man a wailin sax
I must admit they had a rockin band
Man they were blowin like a hurrican

Thats why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks were dancin and got all shook up

And started playin that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
Its got a back beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rockroll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear them play a tango
Im in no mood to take a mambo
Its way too early for a congo
So keep on rockin that piano

Thats why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
Its got a black beat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Oughta got rockroll music

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy name o Rocky Raccoona
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon
Checked into his room
Only to find Gideons Bible
Rocky had come
Equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems
Had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill
And she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now she and her man
Who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
ARocky burst in
And grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown

But Daniel was hot
And he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Aah

Now the doctor came in
Stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better
Ill be better Doc as soon as I am able

Anow Rocky Raccoon
He fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons Bible Daa dadada

And he left it no doubt Rocky
To help with good Rockys revival Ohhh

And my soul keeps asinging the blues

Sittin down by the rhythm revues
Roll over Beethoven

Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further and areel and rock it

Dont you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Dives like a spinnin top

S long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Well roll over Beethoven
Yeah roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Oh roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

Well Id rather see you dead little girl
Than to be with another man
Youd better keep your head little girl
Or I wont know where I am

Youd better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end little girl

Well you know that Im a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I cant spend my whole life trying
Just to make you toe the line

Youd better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything Ive said

And Id rather see you dead

Youd better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
I catch you with another man
Thats the end little girl

Than to be with another man
Youd better keep your head little girl
Or you wont know where I am

Youd better run for your life if you can little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
Thats the end little girl

After the Savoy truffle

Wednesday morning at five oclock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She We gave her most of our lives
Is leaving Sacrificed most of our lives
Home We gave her everything money could buy
Shes leaving home after living alone Bye bye
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

She We never thought of ourselves
Is leaving Never a thought for ourselves
Home We struggled hard all our lives to get by
Shes leaving home after living alone Bye bye
For so many years

Friday morning at nine oclock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied Bye bye
For so many years

Shes leaving home
Bye bye

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Day after day alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that hes just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohh ohohohoh ohhohoh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that theyre the fool
They dont like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
Ive seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times Ive been alone
And many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know
The many ways Ive tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Dont keep me waiting here
Dont keep me waiting
Lead me to your door

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Somehow I will know
Someday when Im lonely
Wishing you werent so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say youll be mine girl
Till the end of time

Someday when were dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and thats enough

Some day when were dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Ive got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows

Turn off your mind
Relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying

Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining

That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being

That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing

But listen to the
Colour of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living

Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

Of the beginning

I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase One in which Doris gets her oats

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someones hardearned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
Were on our way home
Were on our way home
Were going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
Were on our way home
Were on our way home
Were going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
Were on our way home
Were on our way home
Were going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
Were on our way home
Were on our way home
Were going home

Were going home
Better believe it
Goodbye

Its been a long time 
Now Im coming back home 
Ive been away now 
Oh how Ive been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
Well forget the tears we cried 

But if your heart breaks 
Dont wait
Turn me away 
And if your hearts strong 
Hold on
I wont delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
Well forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That Ive been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
Ill trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 

Its been a long time 
Now Im coming back home 
Ive been away now 
Oh how Ive been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
Well forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That Ive been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
Ill trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 

But if your heart breaks 
Dont wait
Turn me away 
And if your hearts strong 
Hold on
I wont delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
Well forget the tears we cried 

Its been a long time 
Now Im coming back home 
Ive been away now 
Oh how Ive been alone

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
Its so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
Its so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why 

What goes on in your heart

I used to think of noone else
But you were just the same
You didnt even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart
What goes on in your mind
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

Look what youre doing
Im feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What youre doing to me

You got me running
And theres no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What youre doing to me

Ive been waiting here for you
Wondering what youre gonna do
And should you need a love thats true
Its me

Please stop your lying
You got me crying girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What youre doing to me

Ive been waiting here for you
Wondering what youre gonna do
And should you need a love thats true
Its me

You have got me crying girl

I got a whole lot of thing to tell her
When I get home

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine

If Id been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When Im sixtyfour

Youll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

Doing the garden digging the weeds
Who could ask for more
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When Im sixtyfour

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if its not too dear
We shall scrimp and save we shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When Im sixtyfour

I look at you all
See the love there thats sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I dont know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I dont know how someone controlled you
They bought and soold you

I look at the world
And I notice its turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Yeah

I dont know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I dont know how you were inverted
Noone alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there thats sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeeeeeps

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Go

Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song
And Ill try not to sing out of key

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then its far too late
When they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize its all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see youre really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love thats gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They dont know
They cant see
Are you one of them

When youve seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
Were all one and life flows on within you and without you

Hold me close
And tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real

Words of love
You whisper soft and true
Darling I love you

Let me hear you say
The words I long to hear
Darling when youre near

Words of love you
Whisper soft and true
Darling I love you

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine

Full steam ahead Mr Boatswain full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is Sergeant
Cut the cable Drop the cable
Ayeaye sir ayeaye
Captain captain

As we live a life of ease a life of ease
Every one of us every one of us has all we need has all we need
Sky of blue sky of blue and sea of green sea of green
In our yellow in our yellow submarine submarine haha

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college money spent
See no future pay no rent
All the moneys gone nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow nowhere to go
But oh that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Ahhhhh ahahhhhaah
Ahhhhh ahahhhhaah
Ahhhhh ahah aah aah

Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true
Today
Came true
Today
Came true
Today
Yes it did
N ah ah ah ah ah ahh ah

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If shes gone I cant go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey youve got to hide your love away
Hey youve got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state Im in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey youve got to hide your love away
Hey youve got to hide your love away
