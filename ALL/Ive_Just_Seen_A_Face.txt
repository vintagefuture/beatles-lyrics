I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
