Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty
Sound of music as she flies

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mm, Mother Nature's son
